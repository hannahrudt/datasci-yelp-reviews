# datasci-yelp-reviews
Project using NLP to explore Yelp reviews and star ratings

## Project Description:
### My project partner and I used this class project as an opportunity to find and clean our own dataset, use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to highlight different features of the data, and compare various classifiers with different feature inputs to predict relationships between Yelp star ratings and the corresponding text reviews. 

## Contributions and Strengths:
- Pitched the main questions and methods used in the project; I am able to read and understand large datasets to produce research questions that can provide deeper insight with data science methods.

- Scaled topic modeling of the text reviews to predict whether a business was a restaurant or not; compared multiple classifiers run on topic model features and tweaked to improve results from a baseline f1 test of 0.714 to a final f1 test of 0.756.

- Increased complexity of topic modeling outside of course material with a multiclass classifier to predict one of six types of restaurants (Mexican, Pizza, Chinese, Italian, American, and other) based on the text reviews. Exemplifies excitement to learn about deeper problem-solving and curiosity to find more applicable insights.

- Created visualizations with various Python packages that relied on visual cues to communicate results effectively and support written insights gleaned from the data.


## Repository organization:
- [HTML final version] is uploaded here; all original files (dataset, cleaning, outside dictionaries, etc.) can be zipped and sent by email.
