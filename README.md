# datasci-yelp-reviews
Project using NLP to explore Yelp reviews and star ratings

## Project Description:
### My partner and I used this class project as an opportunity to find and clean our own dataset, use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to highlight different features of the data, and compare various classifiers with different feature inputs to predict relationships between Yelp star ratings and the corresponding text reviews. 

## Contributions and Strengths:
- Pitched the main questions and methods used in the project; I am able to read and understand large datasets to produce research questions that can provide deeper insight with data science methods.

- Used topic modeling of the text reviews to predict whether a business was a restaurant or not; compared multiple classifiers and tweaked to optimize our results.
